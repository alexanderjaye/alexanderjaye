## Hey, I'm Alex ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
I'm a junior full-stack developer with a passion for all things Typescript!

### About Me
I started learning programming in March 2020 with C++, however I ported my learning to Typescript (& by extension Javascript) as I found it balanced my fondness for the strong typing of C and the ability to make things happen! I took a software development bootcamp course, graduating in Feb 2021. I love to learn & create... so needless to say I'm enjoying the start of my career as a programmer!

ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ Hiring? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ I'm currently available for work based in South East U.K. & open to work in the wider U.K. and Canada.
